Dear Editor,

please find enclosed our submission ``Checkpointing Strategies for
Shared High-Performance Computing Platforms" that we submit to IJNC.
This manuscript is intended for the APDCM 2018 special issue.

A shorter version of this work has appeared in the proceedings of
APDCM 2018 under the title ``Optimal Cooperative Checkpointing for
Shared High-Performance Computing Platforms''.  We have extended the
latter version by considering the integration of burst buffers into
the machine architecture. We extended the simulations to take this
hardware into account and demonstrate how this impacts the contention
issue and provides an alternative solution to scheduling of I/Os due
to periodical checkpointing.

With regards,
