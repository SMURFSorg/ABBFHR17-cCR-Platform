\noindent {Dear APDCM organizers,}\\

\noindent
Please find enclosed our submission ``Checkpointing Strategies for
Shared High-Performance Computing Platforms" that we submit to IJNC.
This manuscript is intended for the APDCM 2018 special issue.

\bigskip
\noindent
A shorter version of this work has appeared in the proceedings of
APDCM 2018 under the title ``Optimal Cooperative Checkpointing for
Shared High-Performance Computing Platforms''.  

\bigskip
\noindent
We have considerably extended the
latter version by considering the integration of burst buffers into
the machine architecture. 
First, we have provided a new section (Section 5) to extend the model
and modify all scheduling strategies to account for these additional hardware resources.
Second, we have thoroughly extended the simulations (new Section 7.3) to take burst buffers
into account and demonstrate how they impact the contention
issue and provide an alternative solution to scheduling of I/Os due
to periodical checkpointing.

\bigskip
\noindent
Altogether, the current manuscript extends the workshop paper with more than $30\%$ of new material.
We have updated the title of the paper to reflect the changes.

\bigskip
\noindent
With regards,\\
Thomas Herault (on behalf of all authors)
