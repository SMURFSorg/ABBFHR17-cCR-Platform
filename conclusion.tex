In this paper we presented a comprehensive model to capture interference
between multiple applications performing fault-tolerance related I/O
on a shared HPC system. We proved that ... We designed multiple algorithms
to schedule and order the checkpointing I/O workload, with the intent of
diminishing the average slowdown sustained by applications on the
platform induced by sharing the I/O subsystem, \ie improve the throughput
of the platform. We designed a event-based simulator that permits
executing typical HPC workloads on current and prospective systems.
With this simulator we have been able to offer guidances as to the
preferred heuristics for scheduling checkpoint workloads, and the
general I/O requirements for future HPC systems to sustain checkpointing.
