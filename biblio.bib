  abstract =     {{The advent of extreme scale machines will require the use of
                  parallel resources at an unprecedented scale, probably leading
                  to a high rate of hardware faults. High Performance Computing
                  (HPC) applications that aim at exploiting all these resources
                  will thus need to be resilient, \emph{i.e.}, be able to
                  compute a correct solution in presence of faults. In this
                  work, we investigate possible remedies in the framework of the
                  solution of large sparse linear systems that is often the
                  inner most numerical kernel in many scientific and engineering
                  applications and also one of the most time consuming
                  part. More precisely, we present recovery followed by
                  restarting strategies in the framework of Krylov subspace
                  solvers where lost entries of the iterate are interpolated to
                  define a new initial guess before restarting. In particular,
                  we consider two interpolation policies that preserve key
                  numerical properties of well-known solvers, namely the
                  monotony decrease of the A-norm of the error of the conjugate
                  gradient (CG) or the residual norm decrease of GMRES. We
                  assess the impact of the recovery method, the fault rate and
                  the number of processors on the robustness of the resulting
                  linear solvers. We consider experiments with CG, GMRES and
                  Bi-CGStab.}},

ABSTRACT="Fault tolerance and degradable performance has given rise to
considerable interest in models for the combined evaluation of
performance and reliability. Beaudry [1] proposed a simple method. First
we generalize the method to semi-Markov reward process. Second, we
remove the restriction requiring the association of zero award to
absorbing states only. We illustrate the approach with three interesting
applications.",

We first show that it is impossible to solve this problem without failure detectors. We then show how to solve it using a new failure detector, called heartbeat. In contrast to previous failure detectors that have been used to circumvent impossibility results, the heartbeat failure detector is implementable, and its implementation does not use timeouts. These results have wide applicability: they can be used to transform many existing algorithms that tolerate only process crashes into quiescent algorithms that tolerate both process crashes and message losses. This can be applied to consensus, atomic broadcast, k-set agreement, atomic commitment, etc. The heartbeat failure detector is novel: besides being implementable without timeouts, it does not output lists of suspects as typical failure detectors do. If we restrict failure detectors to output only lists of suspects, quiescent reliable communication requires , which is not implementable. Combined with the results of this paper, this shows that traditional failure detectors that output only lists of suspects have fundamental limitations.",

@inproceedings{Bartlett86Tandem,
	abstract = "Tandem builds single-fault-tolerant computer systems. At the hardware level, the system is designed as a loosely coupled multi-processor with fail-fast modules connected via dual paths. It is designed for online diagnosis and maintenance. A range of CPUs may be inter-connected via a hierarchical fault-tolerant local network. A variety of peripherals needed for online transaction processing are attached via dual ported controllers. A novel disc subsystem allows a choice between low cost-per-megabyte and low cost-per-access. System software provides processes and messages as the basic structuring mechanism. Processes provide software modularity and fault isolation. Process pairs tolerate hardware and transient software failures. Applications are structured as requesting processes making remote procedure calls to server processes. Process server classes utilize multi-processors. The resulting process abstractions provide a distributed system which can utilize thousands of processors. High-level networking protocols such as SNA, OSI, and a proprietary network are built atop this base. A relational database provides distributed data and distributed transactions. An application generator allows users to develop fault-tolerant applications as though the system were a conventional computer. The resulting system has price/performance competitive with conventional systems.",

A group failure detection protocol has to inform all the non-crashed members of the group that this group entity has crashed. Ideally, such a protocol should be live (if a process crashes, then the group failure has to be detected) and safe (if a group failure is claimed, then at least one process has crashed).Unreliable asynchronous distributed systems are characterized by the impossibility for a process to get an accurate view of the system state. Consequently, the design of a group failure detection protocol that is both safe and live is a problem that can not be solved in all runs of an asynchronous distributed system.This paper analyses a group failure detection protocol whose design naturally ensures its liveness. We show that by tuning appropriately some of its duration-related parameters, the safety property can be guaranteed with a probability as close to $1$ as desired. This analysis shows that, in real distributed systems, it is possible to achieve failure detection with a negligible probability of wrong suspicions.",

Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are ?computation has terminated,? ? the system is deadlocked? and ?all tokens in a token ring have disappeared.? The stable property detection problem is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property. Global state detection can also be used for checkpointing.",

	abstract = "We study the quality of service (QoS) of failure detectors. By QoS, we mean a specification that quantifies 1) how fast the failure detector detects actual failures and 2) how well it avoids false detections. We first propose a set of QoS metrics to specify failure detectors for systems with probabilistic behaviors, i.e., for systems where message delays and message losses follow some probability distributions. We then give a new failure detector algorithm and analyze its QoS in terms of the proposed metrics. We show that, among a large class of failure detectors, the new algorithm is optimal with respect to some of these QoS metrics. Given a set of failure detector QoS requirements, we show how to compute the parameters of our algorithm so that it satisfies these requirements and we show how this can be done,even if the probabilistic behavior of the system is not known. We then present some simulation results that show that the new failure detector algorithm provides a better QoS than an algorithm that is commonly used in practice. Finally, we suggest some ways to make our failure detector adaptive to changes in the probabilistic behavior of the network.",

Both kinds of models encourage exploitation of formal loopholes, rather than rewarding development of techniques that yield performance across a range of current and future parallel machines. This paper offers a new parallel machine model, called LogP, that reflects the critical technology trends underlying parallel computers. it is intended to serve as a basis for developing fast, portable parallel algorithms and to offer guidelines to machine designers. Such a model must strike a balance between detail and simplicity in order to reveal important bottlenecks without making analysis of interesting problems intractable. The model is based on four parameters that specify abstractly the computing bandwidth, the communication bandwidth, the communication delay, and the efficiency of coupling communication and computation. Portable parallel algorithms typically adapt to the machine configuration, in terms of these parameters. The utility of the model is demonstrated through examples that are implemented on the CM-5.",

Currently, several commercial systems and publicly available libraries exist to support various flavors of checkpointing. Programmers typically use these systems if they are satisfactory or otherwise embed checkpointing support themselves within the application. In this paper, we project the performance and functionality of checkpointing algorithms and systems as we know them today into the future. We start by surveying the current technology roadmap and particularly how Peta-Flop capable systems may be plausibly constructed in the next few years. We consider how rollback-recovery as practiced today will fare when systems may have to be constructed out of thousands of nodes. Our projections predict that, unlike current practice, the effect of rollback-recovery may play a more prominent role in how systems may be configured to reach the desired performance level. System planners may have to devote additional resources to enable rollback-recovery and the current practice of using "cheap commodity" systems to form large-scale clusters may face serious obstacles. We suggest new avenues for research to react to these trends.},

With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.",

The label distribution protocol is used in many MPLS networks for distributing labels to establish the label switched paths. This article focuses on LDP failures, namely failures that may occur in LDP while the underlining interior gateway protocol of choice, and the physical connections are operating normally. Since LDP and MPLS in general do not have intrinsic means for detecting these failures, new mechanisms have to be introduced to handle them. Furthermore, the IGP may remain unaware of the LDP failure, and continue to direct traffic to the faulty path. To resolve this situation, coupling between LDP and the routing protocol may have to be introduced. In this article, we discuss all aspects related to handling LDP failures: discovery, location, notification, recovery, and prevention.",

	abstract = "The detection of process failures is a crucial problem system designers have to cope with in order to build fault-tolerant distributed platforms. Unfortunately, it is impossible to distinguish with certainty a crashed process from a very slow process in a purely asynchronous distributed system. This prevents some problems from being solved in such systems. That is why failure detector oracles have been introduced to circumvent these impossibility results. The paper presents a relatively simple protocol that allows a process to monitor another process, and consequently to detect its crash. This protocol relies as much as possible on application messages to do this monitoring. Different from previous process crash detection protocols, it uses control messages only when no application message is sent by the monitoring process to the observed process. When the underlying system satisfies the partial synchrony assumption, it actually implements an eventually perfect failure detector (i.e., a failure detector of the class usually denoted OP). Moreover if the average observed transmission delay is finite and the upper layer application terminates within a bounded number of steps for any failure detector in OP after the failure detector becomes perfect, then, when run with the proposed protocol, it also terminates correctly. These properties make the protocol inexpensive, implementable, and powerful. The paper also describes performance measurements of an implementation of the protocol",

The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.",

	abstract = "Process groups in distributed applications and services rely on failure detectors to detect process failures completely, and as quickly, accurately, and scalably as possible, even in the face of unreliable message deliveries. In this paper, we look at quantifying the optimal scalability, in terms of network load, (in messages per second, with messages having a size limit) of distributed, complete failure detectors as a function of application-specified requirements. These requirements are 1) quick failure detection by some non-faulty process, and 2) accuracy of failure detection. We assume a crash-recovery (non-Byzantine) failure model, and a network model that is probabilistically unreliable (w.r.t. message deliveries and process failures). First, we characterize, under certain independence assumptions, the optimum worst-case network load imposed by any failure detector that achieves an application's requirements. We then discuss why traditional heart beating schemes are inherently unscalable according to the optimal load. We also present a randomized, distributed, failure detector algorithm that imposes an equal expected load per group member. This protocol satisfies the application defined constraints of completeness and accuracy, and speed of detection on an average. It imposes a network load that differs frown the optimal by a sub-optimality factor that is much lower than that for traditional distributed heartbeating schemes. Moreover, this sub-optimality factor does not vary with group size (for large groups).",

@inproceedings{Gupta02EpidemicStyleMulticast,
	abstract = "Epidemic-style (gossip-based) techniques have recently emerged as a scalable class of protocols for peer-to-peer reliable multicast dissemination in large process groups. These protocols provide probabilistic guarantees on reliability and scalability. However, popular implementations of epidemic-style dissemination are reputed to suffer from two major drawbacks: (a) (Network Overhead) when deployed on a WAN-wide or VPN-wide scale they generate a large number of packets that transit across the boundaries of multiple network domains (e.g., LANs, subnets, ASs), causing an overload on core network elements such as bridges, routers, and associated links; (b) (Lack of Adaptivity) they impose the same load on process group members and the network even under reduced failure rates (viz., packet losses, process failures). In this paper, we report on the (first) comprehensive set of solutions to these problems. The solution is comprised of two protocols: (1) a Hierarchical Gossiping protocol, and (2) an Adaptive multicast Dissemination Framework that allows use of any gossiping primitive within it. These protocols work within a virtual peer-to-peer hierarchy called the Leaf Box Hierarchy. Processes can be allocated in a topologically aware manner to the leaf boxes of this structure, so that (1) and (2) produce low traffic across domain boundaries in the network. In the interests of space, this paper focuses on a detailed discussion and evaluation (through simulations) of only the Hierarchical Gossiping protocol. We present an overview of the Adaptive Dissemination protocol and its properties.",

Transitlessness can be seen as a dual of traditional consistency. Strong consistency is the addition of transitlessness to traditional consistency. The main result of the paper is a statement of the necessary and sufficient condition answering the following question: ?given an arbitrary set of local checkpoints, can this set be extended to a global checkpoint that satisfies P?

We here propose a Grid Workflow System (Grid-WFS), a flexible failure handling framework for the Grid, which addresses these Grid-unique failure recovery requirements. Central to the framework is flexibility in handing failures. We describe how to achieve the flexibility by the use of workflow structure as a high-level recovery policy specification. We show how this use of high-level workflow structure allows users to achieve failure recovery in a variety of ways depending on the requirements and constraints of their applications. We also demonstrate that this use of workflow structure enables users to not only rapidly prototype and investigate failure handling strategies, but also easily change them by simply modifying the encompassing workflow structure, while the application code remains intact. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our framework using a simulation, demonstrating the value of supporting multiple failure recovery techniques in Grid systems to achieve high performance in the presence of failures.",

	abstract = "Failure detectors are an integral part of any fault tolerant distributed system and hence have been a well-studied area. However, earlier proposed failure detectors fail to perform efficiently when applied to Grid environments. Most of the earlier proposed detectors were either designed for local area networks or to handle small number of nodes and hence lack in areas such as scalability, efficiency, running times etc. In this paper we propose a highly scalable failure detector protocol that is aided by a membership management service. The membership management service is essential to make the failure detector transparent to changes in the system. Using a distributed heartbeat mechanism, for an unreliable failure detector, we have overcome the shortcomings of similar schemes proposed earlier. It realizes scalability by reducing context switching requirements and achieves faster failure detection . The membership management protocol handles membership issues with a worst case complexity of O(n) where n is the number of heartbeat groups. Note that  is much smaller than the total number of nodes in the Grid. The algorithm is also shown to be failure resilient and scalable.",

A Tree-based Reliable Multicast Protocol (TRAM) provides scalable reliable multicast by grouping receivers in hierarchical repair groups and using a selective acknowledgment mechanism. In this paper, we present an improvement to TRAM to minimize the resource utilization at intermediate hosts and to localize the effect of slow or malicious receivers on normal receivers. We present an evaluation of TRAM and TRAM++ on a campus-wide WAN without errors and with message errors. The evaluation brings out that, given a constraint on the buffer availability at intermediate hosts, TRAM++ can tolerate the constraint at the expense of increasing the end-to-end latency for the normal receivers by only 3.2\% compared to TRAM in error-free cases. When slow or faulty receivers are present, TRAM++ is able to provide the same uninterrupted quality of service to the normal nodes while localizing the effect of the faulty ones without incurring any additional memory overhead.",

Our system achieves connection-level failover across both local- and wide-area server replication, without requiring a frontend transport- or application-layer switch. Our approach uses recently proposed end-to-end ?connection migration? mechanisms for transport protocols such as TCP, combined with a soft-state session synchronization protocol between replica servers. The end result is a robust, fast, and fine-grained connection failover mechanism that is transparent to client applications, and largely transparent to the server applications. We describe the details of our design and Linux implementation, as well as experimental data that suggests this approach is an attractive way to engineer robust systems for distributing long-running streams; connections suffer relatively small performance degradation even when migration occurs every few seconds, and the associated server overhead is small.",

Existing TCP connections are retained using secure and efficient connection migration, enabling established connections to seamlessly negotiate a change in endpoint IP addresses without the need for a third party. Our architecture is secure?name updates are effected via the secure DNS update protocol, while TCP connection migration uses a novel set of Migrate options?and provides a pure end-system alternative to routing-based approaches such as Mobile IP. Mobile IP was designed under the principle that fixed Internet hosts and applications were to remain unmodified and only the underlying IP substrate should change. Our architecture requires no changes to the unicast IP substrate, instead modifying transport protocols and applications at the end hosts. We argue that this is not a hindrance to deployment; rather, in a significant number of cases, it allows for an easier deployment path than Mobile IP, while simultaneously giving better performance. We compare and contrast the strengths of end-to-end and network-layer mobility schemes, and argue that end-to-end schemes are better suited to many common mobile applications. Our performance experiments show that handoff times are governed by TCP migrate latencies, and are on the order of a round-trip time of the communicating peers.",

The introduction of vector computers started the area of ???Supercomputing???. The initial success of vector computers in the seventies was driven by raw performance. Massive parallel systems (MPP) became successful in the early nineties due to their better price/performance ratios, which was enabled by the attack of the ???killer-micros???. The success of microprocessor based on the shared memory concept (referred to as symmetric multiprocessors (SMP)) even for the very high-end systems, was the basis for the emerging cluster concepts in the early 2000s. Within the first half of this decade clusters of PC???s and workstations have become the prevalent architecture for many HPC application areas on all ranges of performance. However, the Earth Simulator vector system demonstrated that many scientific applications could benefit greatly from other computer architectures. At the same time there is renewed broad interest in the scientific HPC community for new hardware architectures and new programming paradigms. The IBM BlueGene/L system is one early example of a shifting design focus for large-scale system.

This research is especially relevant for today's low overhead communication systems that employ dedicated processing elements for protocol processing. We develop an abstract pipeline model that reveals a crucial performance tradeoff involving the effects of the overhead of the bottleneck stage and the bandwidth of the remaining stages. We exploit this tradeoff to develop a suite of fragmentation algorithms designed to minimize message latency. We also provide an experimental methodology that enables the construction of customized pipeline algorithms that can adapt to the specific system characteristics and application workloads. By applying this methodology to the Myrinet-GAM system, we have improved its latency by up to 51\%. Our theoretical framework is also applicable to pipelined systems beyond the context of high speed networks.",

	abstract = "Process checkpointing is a basic mechanism required for providing High Throughput Computing service on distributively owned resources. We present a new process checkpoint and migration technique, called process hijacking, that uses dynamic program re-writing techniques to add checkpointing capability to a running program. Process hijacking makes it possible to checkpoint and migrate proprietary applications that cannot be re-linked with a checkpoint library, and it makes it possible to dynamically hand off an ordinary running process to a distributed resource management system such as Condor. We discuss the problems of adding checkpointing capability to a program already in execution: (1) loading new code into the running process, and (2) replacing functions of the process with calls to dynamically loaded functions. We use the DynInst API process editing library, augmented with a new call for replacing functions, to solve these problems. We discuss problems associated with migrating a hijacked process: (1) safely restoring the dynamically assembled address space of the hijacked process from a checkpoint, and (2) preserving the uncheckpointable operating system state of the hijacked process for migration. We preserve uncheckpointable operating system state by spawning a shadow process from the hijacked process. We have used process hijacking to migrate a variety of programs, including a running, unmodified Java VM. We show that the migration performance of hijacking is comparable to that of Condor.",
