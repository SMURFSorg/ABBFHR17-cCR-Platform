                  parallel resources at an unprecedented scale, probably leading
                  to a high rate of hardware faults. High Performance Computing
                  (HPC) applications that aim at exploiting all these resources
                  will thus need to be resilient, \emph{i.e.}, be able to
                  compute a correct solution in presence of faults. In this
                  work, we investigate possible remedies in the framework of the
                  solution of large sparse linear systems that is often the
                  inner most numerical kernel in many scientific and engineering
                  applications and also one of the most time consuming
                  part. More precisely, we present recovery followed by
                  restarting strategies in the framework of Krylov subspace
                  solvers where lost entries of the iterate are interpolated to
                  define a new initial guess before restarting. In particular,
                  we consider two interpolation policies that preserve key
                  numerical properties of well-known solvers, namely the
                  monotony decrease of the A-norm of the error of the conjugate
                  gradient (CG) or the residual norm decrease of GMRES. We
                  assess the impact of the recovery method, the fault rate and
                  the number of processors on the robustness of the resulting
                  linear solvers. We consider experiments with CG, GMRES and
                  Bi-CGStab.}},

ABSTRACT="Fault tolerance and degradable performance has given rise to
considerable interest in models for the combined evaluation of
performance and reliability. Beaudry [1] proposed a simple method. First
we generalize the method to semi-Markov reward process. Second, we
remove the restriction requiring the association of zero award to
absorbing states only. We illustrate the approach with three interesting
applications.",
