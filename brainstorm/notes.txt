SMURF work meeting: 

General problem: Interference I/O intra-inter from C/R; Model for platform efficiency with multiple apps

Dali-opt: proba of interference -> distance to real optimal due to increase in C

strategies: some app C/R, some do not: is efficiency better?

new Dali: optimal freq for multiple applications considering the spread of the 
random variable with inter-C/R
  Step2: Dali-interopt: accounting for interference, what is new Daliopt? 
  Step3: dali-opt + delay (to avoid interference), how far from real opt?
  Step4: optimization against risk (favor large apps, favor apps with oldest ckpt)

problem: how long each app lasts? that's difficult to estimate
how to model w/o conditional probas?
burst buffer impact?

open question: 
how many jobs checkpoint simultaneously? 
  hypothesis: 1 job saturates the I/O so that's enough
  dig: how many jobs are needed to saturate I/O with C/R ?
    we need app traces to know I/O observed (and C/R activities w/r to memory size)

Panda paper: checkpoint scheduling: does it already covers the case where C/q is equal 
  everywhere and we just do checkpoint staggering (find ref)?
