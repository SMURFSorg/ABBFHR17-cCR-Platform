Dear Editor,

<<<<<<< .mine
Please find attached the revision of our manuscript entitled 
"Checkpointing Strategies for Shared High-Performance Computing Platforms" 
that we submit for possible publication in the IJNC's special issue of the APDCM Workshop 2018.

We have addressed all comments from the reviewers, as detailed below.

Yours sincerely,
Yves Robert (on behalf of all authors)


----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------

- In proposed the strategies,  application knowledge,  small job size, code refactoring
are required for minimizing the platform waste, which in many cases is not practical.

Answer: We have included a few sentences about the applicability of our approach in the introduction.


----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------
- Nothing has been added to the related work on the new topic burst buffers

Answer: we have extended the related work to discuss burst buffers.

- The lines of "oblivious-fixed and "oblivious-fixed with burst-buffer" in Fig 4 and 6 are both depicted in (a different kind of) red, please adjust this

Answer: Problem fixed.

----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------

- Abstract should be totally rewritten, because it is vague. It presents the background and purpose of this work, while it does not show any of the important results and findings.

Answer: we have rewritten the abstract

- Page 6, Eq.(1)  This reviewer could not follow the induction of Eq.(1).
Modify or add the explanation.
W_i is the sum of W_i(j) of C_IO and C_Ckpt.
Sum{W_i(j) in C_IO} = q_j (d_j +v_i)
Sum{W_i(j) in C_Ckpt} = v_i q_j^2 / mu_ind (xxxxx)
So, W_i should be Sigma{W_i(j) in C_IO} + v_i Sigma{ q_j^2 / mu_ind (xxxxx)}.
However. Eq(1) shows that W_i = v_i (Sigma{W_i(j) in C_IO} + Sigma{ q_j^2 / mu_ind (xxxxx)}.
BTW, there is no discrepancy between Eq(1) and Eq(2).

Answer: thanks for pointing out this mistake. We have corrected the error and rewritten the equation.

-It is also recommended to add [units] to each symbol. It would help the readers to follow the logic and calculation.

Answer: added that all symboles (period, checkpoint, recovery, wasted time) are expressed in seconds. Waste is a percentage, hence without unit.

- Figures 8 and 9: there are lines with/without variances. What are the differences?
Can you explain or modify the explanations or graphs?

Answer: Thomas.
