  In high-performance computing environments, input/output (I/O) from various sources
  often contend for shared interconnection network resources.  For example, I/O from
  concurrently running computations can contend with each other as well as with I/O
  from checkpoint/restart (CR) services used to protect these computations from
  platform faults and failures. Without careful consideration, contending I/O from
  independently operating sources can lead to significant performance degradation. In
  this work, we consider a cooperative I/O scheduling policy that optimizes the way
  concurrently executing, CR-based applications share interconnection networks.
  Using this cooperative policy, applications checkpoint sequentially, with a dynamic,
  priority-dependent frequency dictated by the scheduler. When enough I/O bandwidth
  is available, each application checkpoints with its optimal period. However, when
  I/O bandwidth is scarce, our scheduling algorithm provides an optimal checkpoint
  process that maximizes platform throughput. Our results show ...
