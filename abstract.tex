  In high-performance computing environments, input/output (I/O) from various
sources often contend for scare available bandwidth. Adding to these I/O
operations inherent to the failure-free execution of these applications, I/O
from checkpoint/restart (CR) operations used to ensure progress in the presence
of failures,  places an additional burden as it increases I/O contention which
leads to degraded performance.
%  aggravates the problem. Without careful consideration, contending I/O from
%  independently operating sources will lead to significant performance
%  degradation.  especially for capacity I/O loads such as the I/O from
%  checkpoint/restart (CR) services used to protect these computations from
%  platform faults.  For example, I/O from concurrently running applications
%  can contend with each other as well as with other I/O loads, such as the I/O
%  from checkpoint/restart (CR) services used to protect these computations
%  from platform faults.
  In this work, we consider a cooperative scheduling policy that optimizes the
overall performance of concurrently executing CR-based applications which share
valuable I/O resources.  First, we provide a theoretical model and derive a set
of necessary constraints needed to minimize the global \emph{waste} on the
platform.

  Our results demonstrate that the optimal checkpoint interval as defined by
Young/Daly, while providing a sensible metric for a single application, is not
sufficient to optimally address resource contention at the platform scale.  We
therefore show that combining optimal checkpointing periods with I/O scheduling
strategies can provide a significant improvement on the overall application
performance, thereby maximizing platform throughput.

Overall, these results provide critical analysis and direct guidance on checkpointing
large-scale workloads in the presence of competing I/O while minimizing the impact
on application performance.
