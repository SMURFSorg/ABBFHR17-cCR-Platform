\subsection{LANL APEX Simulation Workflows on Cielo}

We consider the workload from LANL found in the APEX Workflows
report~\cite{apex2016} that consists of four applications classes: EAP, LAP,
Silverton and VPIC. The main characteristics of these classes are reported in
Table~\ref{table:lanl}. We simulate the behavior of these applications on the
Cielo Platform. Cielo was a 1.37 Petaflops capability system operated from 2010
to 2016 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  It consisted of 143,104 cores,
286 TB of main memory, and a parallel filesystem with a theoretical maximum
capacity of 160GB/s.  Cielo was chosen for this initial analysis due to the
availability of the aforementioned workflows report, something not available for
other platforms. In later sections, we consider similar workloads on a more
modern platform.

The baseline in this comparison comprises a set of simulations with no faults,
checkpoints, nor I/O interference. For these simulations, we selected a 60-day
execution segment, and computed the resources used by the jobs during this
period, \ie the total time each node spent on (non-CR) I/O and computation in a
failure-free environment.

For the I/O scheduling techniques presented in Section~\ref{sec:algorithms}, we
compute the resource waste as the total time nodes spend not progressing jobs.
In the figures presented, we represent the performance of each strategy by
computing the waste ratio, \ie the resource waste over a segment of 60 days
divided by the application resource usage over that same segment for the
baseline simulation. Each simulation is conducted over 1,000 times; the
candlestick extremes represent the first and last decile of the measures, while
the boxes represent the first and last quartile, and the center the mean value.

  \caption{Waste ratio as a function of the system bandwidth for the
    seven I/O and Checkpointing scheduling strategies, and the LANL workload on
    Cielo. \label{fig:cielo-1hmtbf}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Impact of Available System Bandwidth}
First, we explore the performance of each approach in a failure-prone
environment. Figure~\ref{fig:cielo-1hmtbf} represents the waste ratio
on Cielo, assuming the node MTBF $\muind$ of 2 years (\ie a system
MTBF of 1h). We vary the filesystem bandwidth from 40 GB/s to 160GB/s
in order to evaluate the impact of this parameter. We observe three
classes of behavior: \propfixed and \bfifofixed exhibit a waste ratio
that decreases as the bandwidth increases, but remains above 40\% even
at the maximum theoretical I/O bandwidth; \fifodaly, \fifofixed, and
\cooperative quickly decrease to below 20\% of waste, and reach
the theoretical model performance\footnote{Maple code to compute the
  performance predicted by the theoretical model is available at
  \url{https://github.com/SMURFSorg/InterferingCheckpoints}.};
%
and \propdaly and \bfifodaly start at the same level of efficiency as
\propfixed and \bfifofixed, and slowly reach 20\% of waste as the bandwidth
increases.
%
Note, in some cases the error bars dip below the theoretical
lower bound. In the simulations, failures have an exponential probability
distribution centered around the desired MTBF. For some runs, a lower
number of failures experienced during the simulation results in a larger
MTBF than the average used in the lower-bound formula; such instances
can experience a waste lower than the theoretical model.

This figure shows that with a high frequency of failures, providing each job
with the appropriate checkpoint interval is paramount to preventing unnecessary
(or even detrimental) checkpoints: the two strategies that render high waste
despite high bandwidth rely on a fixed 1h interval. However, it also shows that
this is not the sole criteria that should be taken into account, nor a
necessary condition to extract performance. Even with favorable bandwidth,
\propdaly and \bfifodaly experience nearly twice the waste of the other
strategies with same checkpointing period. All strategies that decouple the
execution of the application from the filesystem availability (\fifodaly,
\fifofixed, \cooperative) exhibit considerably better performance despite low
bandwidth.

Notably, \cooperative remains the most efficient technique in this study, and
reaches the theoretical performance given by Equation~\eqref{eq.totalwaste} for
steady-state analysis. This illustrates the efficiency of the proposed
heuristic (Equations~\eqref{eq.selection} and~\eqref{eq.selection2}) to
schedule checkpoints and I/O in a way that avoids interferences, allowing the
system to behave as if no interference is experienced, in most cases. The high
variation shows that a minority of the runs experienced a significantly higher
waste, but such is the case for all algorithms.

  \caption{Waste ratio as a function of the system MTBF for the
    seven I/O and Checkpointing scheduling strategies, and the LANL workload on
    Cielo. \label{fig:cielo-40gbs}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Impact of System Reliability}
Next, we explore the performance of each approach under low bandwidth (and
thus high probability of interference). A scenario with such low bandwidth is not
unrealistic.  As shown in Luu et al~\cite{Luu:2015:Multiplatform}, practical
bandwidth can be considerably lower than theoretical.
Figure~\ref{fig:cielo-40gbs} represents the waste ratio on Cielo, assuming the
aggregated filesystem bandwidth of the system is 40GB/s. We vary the node MTBF
$\muind$ from 2 years (1h of system MTBF) to 50 years (24h of system MTBF) in
order to evaluate the impact of this parameter. Similar to
Figure~\ref{fig:cielo-1hmtbf}, we observe three classes of behavior: \propfixed
and \bfifofixed exhibit a waste ratio that remains constant around 80\% for all
values of the MTBF. These approaches are critically dependent on the filesystem
bandwidth, and a lower frequency of failures does not significantly improve
their performance. The I/O subsystem is saturated, and the applications spends
most of their time waiting for it.
%
\propdaly and \bfifodaly, see poor efficiency for small MTBF values, but
steadily improve to come close to the theoretical bound for higher MTBF values.
Lastly, \fifodaly, \fifofixed, and \cooperative quickly reach the theoretical
model performance, even with a low  MTBF (4 year node MTBF or 2h of
system MTBF).

For all the strategies that use the Daly checkpointing period, increasing the
MTBF reduces the amount of I/O required and thus relieves the pressure of a
constrained bandwidth. All strategies that schedule the bandwidth are
successful at increasing the efficiency close to the theoretical model.
%
Similarly, \fifofixed, despite its fixed checkpoint interval is capable of
reaching a performance comparable to the Daly-based strategies (which reduce the
number of total checkpoints). The rapid improvement of the \fifofixed approach can be
explained by a combination of 2 factors. Foremost, the non-blocking aspect of
the checkpoint provide the I/O subsystem with enough flexibility to order the
checkpoint without imposing an additional wait. Delayed checkpoints only translate
in additional waste if that application itself is subject to failure.
Additionally, for lower MTBFs, the more frequent restarts of interfering jobs,
despite the fact that they delay the checkpointing operation, do not introduce
additional waste.

\subsection{Evaluating a Prospective System}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \resizebox{1.05\linewidth}{!}{\input{sim/figures/prosp.tex}}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Minimum aggregated filesystem bandwidth to reach 80\%
    efficiency with the different approaches on the prospective
    future system.\label{fig:prosp}}
\end{figure}

In order to understand the impact of the I/O contention on future platforms, we
use our simulator to explore a prospective system and assess the impact of I/O
and checkpoint scheduling when the problem size and the machine size will
increase. We consider a future system with 7PB of main memory and 50,000
compute nodes (\eg Aurora\footnote{\url{https://aurora.alcf.anl.gov/}}). Based
on the APEX workflow report, we extrapolate the increase in problem size
expected for the application classes considered previously, and project these
applications on the prospective system.  We simulate the workload of
Table~\ref{table:lanl}, scaling the problem size proportionally to the change
in machine memory size. The waste is computed, as previously, by dividing the
amount of resource used for checkpoints and lost due to failures by the amount
of resource used in a fault-free and resilience-free run with the same initial
conditions.
%
We vary system MTBF; and for each strategy, we find the required aggregated
practical bandwidth necessary to provide a sustained 80\% efficiency of the
system.  This 80\% target efficiency is viewed by many programs (\eg 
The Exascale Computing Project\footnote{\url{https://exascaleproject.org}}) as a
reasonable cost for resilience activities.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:prosp} shows the impact of MTBF and strategies on this
prospective system.

When failures are frequent (less than 10 year node MTBF), the most critical
element is to reduce the I/O pressure: all strategies that use a fixed and
frequent checkpoint interval require greater available bandwidth to reach the
target efficiency.  In this case, strategies that combine an optimal
checkpointing period with I/O and checkpoint scheduling (\cooperative and
\fifodaly) perform similarly, consistently better than all other approaches.
These two approaches exhibit a strong resilience to failures, with a bandwidth
requirement that only increases by a factor of three between a very unstable system
(less than one hour system MTBF), and a stable one (an 8 hour system MTBF). In
contrast, the other strategies are much more dependent upon the frequency of
failures; the \propfixed strategy requires up to 50 times the bandwidth of
\cooperative to reach the same efficiency.

When failures are not endemic (\ie a node MTBF is at least 15 years
and a system MTBF of 2.6 hours), the hierarchy of different
approaches stabilizes. The two blocking strategies relying on
frequent checkpoints (\propfixed and \bfifofixed) remain expensive,
requiring the highest bandwidth to reach the target
efficiency. % 6.4TB/s at 24 years
The next contender, \fifofixed, requires a quarter of the  bandwidth
to reach the same efficiency.
% \fifofixed, that uses a fixed checkpoint interval comes next, with a
% requirement around three quarter of the one required by \propfixed and
% \bfifofixed.
Despite using the same fixed checkpoint interval as the previous methods, it
benefits from not blocking when the filesystem is not available.
This is sufficient, when failures are rare, to obtain a significant
performance gain. % 4.9TB/s at 24 years
All Daly-based strategies benefit from reduced I/O pressure, and reach the
target efficiency with around half the bandwidth needed by \propfixed. 
We also observe that \fifodaly and \leastwaste remain the most efficient strategies
for the whole MTBF spectrum. These
results highlight that checkpoint-based strategies can scale to
satisfy the need of future platforms, whether by integrating I/O-aware scheduling
strategies or by significantly over-provisioning the I/O partition.
% Then the four strategies that use the Daly optimal checkpointing
% period, alleviating significantly the I/O pressure, are the ones that
% require the lowest bandwidth to reach 80\% of efficiency, at about
% half the required bandwidth of the current
% situation. %coop: 2.9 TB/s at 24 years
