\section{Lower Bound}
\label{sec:lowerbound}
% Primary: Yves (does that go into a subsec of the algorithms or models?)

In this section we derive a lower bound of the optimal platform waste.
The motivation is to assess the absolute performance of the scheduling
algorithms presented in Section~\ref{sec:algorithms}:
we compare their performance with  this lower bound in the simulations presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

We envision a (theoretical) scenario when the platform operates in steady-state,
with a constant number of jobs per application class spanning the whole platform. We also assume that
the I/O bandwidth $\bandavail$  that is available for CR operations remains constant throughout
execution. This amounts to neglecting initial input and final output I/O operations,
or more precisely, to pretending that these operations span the entire execution of the jobs.
Otherwise, we would need to account for job durations, which renders the
steady-state analysis intractable.
Given the above, we determine the optimal checkpointing period for each application class
when the objective is to minimize the total waste incurred  by the platform, or equivalently,
to maximize the total throughput of the platform. To complicate matters, these optimal periods
may not be achievable,  hence we derive a lower bound of the optimal waste.

In steady-state operation, there are $\nbapp{i}$ jobs of class $\app{i}$,
each using $\nbnodes{i}$ nodes, and with checkpoint time $\ckpt{i}$. Because we orchestrate
checkpoints to avoid CR-CR interferences, we have $\ckpt{i} = \frac{\size{i}}{\bandavail}$,
where $\size{i}$ denote the size of the checkpoint file of all jobs of class $\app{i}$.
The waste of a job is the ratio of time the job spends doing
resilience operations by the time it does useful work. The time spent doing
resilience operations include the time spent during each period to checkpoint,
and in case of failure, the time to rollback to the previous checkpoint, and the
time to recompute lost work.
%We assume
%that the recovery time $\reco{i}$ is equivalent to the checkpoint time  $\ckpt{i}$.
We
can express the waste $\wasteapp{i}$ of a job $J_{i}$ of class
$\app{i}$ that checkpoints with period $\period{i}$
as follows~\cite{springer-monograph}:
\begin{equation}
\wasteapp{i} = \wastefct{i}{\ckpt{i}} = \frac{\ckpt{i}}{\period{i}} +
\frac{\nbnodes{i}}{\mtbfplat}(\frac{\period{i}}{2} + \reco{i})
\label{eq.wasteAi}
\end{equation}

Let $\wasteplat$ be the waste of the platform. We define this as the
weighted arithmetic mean of the $\wasteapp{i}$ for all applications,
where each application is weighted by the number of computing nodes
it uses:

\begin{equation}
\wasteplat = \sum_i \frac{\nbapp{i} \nbnodes{i}}{\nbnodesplat} \wasteapp{i}
\label{eq.waste}
\end{equation}

In the absence of I/O constraints, the checkpointing period can be minimized
for each job independently. Indeed, the optimal period for a job
of class $\app{i}$ is obtained by minimizing $\wasteapp{i}$ in Equation~\eqref{eq.wasteAi}.
Differentiating and solving
$$\frac{\delta \wasteapp{i}}{\delta \period{i}} = - \frac{\ckpt{i}}{\period{i}^{2}} + \frac{\nbnodes{i}}{2 \mtbfplat} = 0$$
we readily derive that
\begin{equation}
\period{i} = \sqrt{2 \frac{\mtbfplat}{\nbnodes{i}} \ckpt{i}} = \sqrt{2 \mu_{i} \ckpt{i}}
\label{eq.daly}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{i}$ is the MTBF of  class $\app{i}$ applications, and we retrieve the Daly period
$\period{i} = \period{Daly}(J_{i})$.

However, I/O constraints may impose the use of sub-optimal periods. If each job
of  class $\app{i}$ checkpoints in time $\ckpt{i}$ during its period $\period{i}$ (hence
without any contention), it uses the I/O device during a fraction $\frac{\ckpt{i}}{\period{i}}$ of the time.
The total usage fraction of the  I/O device is $\ioconstraint = \sum_{i} \frac{\nbapp{i} \ckpt{i}}{\period{i}}$
and cannot exceed $1$. Therefore, we have to solve the following optimization problem: find
the set of values $\period{i}$ that minimize $\wasteplat$ in Equation~\eqref{eq.waste} subject to the I/O constraint:

\begin{equation}
\ioconstraint = \sum_{i} \frac{\nbapp{i} \ckpt{i}}{\period{i}} \leq 1
\label{eq.IOconstraint}
\end{equation}

Hence the optimization problem writes: minimize
\begin{equation}
\wasteplat = \sum_i \frac{\nbapp{i} \nbnodes{i}}{\nbnodesplat}  \left( \frac{\ckpt{i}}{\period{i}} +
\frac{\nbnodes{i}}{\mtbfplat}(\frac{\period{i}}{2} + \reco{i}) \right)
\label{eq.totalwaste}
\end{equation}
subject to Equation~\eqref{eq.IOconstraint}.
Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions~\cite{Boyd2004}, we know that there exists a nonnegative constant
$\lambda$
such that
$$- \frac{\delta \wasteplat}{\delta \period{i}} = \lambda \frac{\delta \ioconstraint}{\delta \period{i}}$$
for all $i$. We derive that
$$\frac{\nbapp{i} \nbnodes{i} \ckpt{i}}{\nbnodesplat \period{i}^{2}} -    \frac{\nbapp{i} \nbnodes{i}^{2}}{2 \mtbfplat \nbnodesplat} = - \lambda \frac{\nbapp{i} \ckpt{i}}{\period{i}^{2}}
$$
for all $i$. This leads to:
 \begin{equation}
\period{i} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \mtbfplat  \nbnodesplat}{\nbnodes{i}^{2}} \left(\frac{\nbnodes{i}}{\nbnodesplat} +\lambda \right) \ckpt{i}}
  \label{eq.KKT}
\end{equation}
for all $i$. Note that when $\lambda=0$, Equation~\eqref{eq.KKT} reduces to Equation~\eqref{eq.daly}.
Because of the I/O constraint in Equation~\eqref{eq.IOconstraint},
we choose for $\lambda$ the minimum value such that Equation~\eqref{eq.IOconstraint}
  is satisfied. If $\lambda \neq 0$, this will lead to periods $P_{i}$ larger
  than the optimal value of Equation~\eqref{eq.daly}. Note that there is no
  closed-form expression for the minimum value of $\lambda$,
  it has to be found numerically.
   Altogether, we state our main result:

   \begin{theorem}
  In the presence of I/O constraints, the optimal values of the checkpointing periods are given
  by Equation~\eqref{eq.KKT}, where $\lambda$ is the smallest nonnegative value such that
  Equation~\eqref{eq.IOconstraint} holds. The total platform waste is then given by
  Equation~\eqref{eq.totalwaste}.
\end{theorem}

The optimal periods may not be achievable, because Equation~\eqref{eq.IOconstraint} is a
necessary condition, but it may not be sufficient:
even though the total I/O bandwidth is not exceeded, meaning there is enough
capacity to take all the checkpoints at the given periods, we would still need to 
orchestrate these checkpoints into a periodic pattern that repeats over time.
In other words, we only have a lower bound of the optimal platform waste.
